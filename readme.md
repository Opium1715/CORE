# Notification
This is an implementation of this paper(**CORE: Simple and Effective Session-based Recommendation within Consistent Representation Space**) based on Pytorch 2.X, which contains the extra functions as below:

- Log(output for loss and MRR@20, P@20)
- train & test progress bar display
- preformance enhanced evaluation for metrics
